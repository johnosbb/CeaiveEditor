## The First Choice For Creative Writing

![Publications](https://github.com/johnosbb/Lyrical/blob/main/Lyrical.png?raw=true)

## Feasability Stage
Goal - Create a application for creative writers that has all the features of a fully fledged editor, grammar checking, spell checker, thesarus, but also incorporates natural language processing and AI to stylise writing based on the styles of the great writers.

### Features
- Full featured editor focused on designing a non-invasive workspace that allows the writer write free of distraction.
- The goals of the software is to make the job of creative writing easier. It does not focus on the formating and layout of documents, but instead creates simple uncluttered workspaces that promote the creative process.
- Grammar checking, Thesarus and reference tools can be invoked through the main editor when required.
- Lyrical will support the complete writing process. It provides support for storing research material, context information, links and meta data for the writers work.
- It will support templates for story arcs.



Research Phase began in January 2022

#### Terminology

| Term | Definition  |
| --- | :-- |
| Stop Words | A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that we may wish to ignore when processing language. NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) in python has a list of stopwords stored in 16 different languages. We can use these tables to eliminate these stop words when processing text for some aspects of style analysis.
