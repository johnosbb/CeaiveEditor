# Projects

A Project is a collection of documents that can represent a literary effort like a novel or book. A project can consist of chapters and other sub-folders that allow the user create a hierarchical structure for their writing.

When we create a new project, we create a new directory. When we add a chapter, we add a sub-folder to that directory.
The Chapter folder can consist of multiple documents.
A project folder can also contain other documents that hold summary or meta data: for example, a chapter folder can contain a chapter outline.
