# Style Transfer

## Overview

There are several projects that focus on literary styles transfer:

"ShakeSpeare: To Write like the Bard" by Shauli Ravfogel et al. This project uses a sequence-to-sequence model to generate Shakespearean-style text from modern English input. The model is trained on a corpus of Shakespeare's works, and the authors demonstrate that it can produce high-quality Shakespearean-style text that closely resembles the original works.

"Neural Style Transfer for Short Texts with Style-Conditioned Word Embeddings" by Jinfeng Li et al. This paper proposes a method for style transfer of short texts, such as poetry and song lyrics. The authors use style-conditioned word embeddings to capture the style of the input text, and then use a neural network to transfer the style to a target style. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several datasets, including song lyrics and poetry.

"Unsupervised Poem Style Transfer with Reinforcement Learning" by Haoyuan Li et al. This paper proposes a method for unsupervised poem style transfer that uses reinforcement learning to learn a mapping from one style to another. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on several datasets, including Tang poetry and Song poetry.

These projects provide examples of how style transfer can be applied to literary styles, and they include code implementations.
