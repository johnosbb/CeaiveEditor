# Sentence Structure

## Parts of a sentence


### Subject

In a sentence, the subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action or is being described. It is typically located at the beginning of a sentence. 

### Predicate

The predicate, on the other hand, is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and any objects or modifiers associated with the verb. It provides information about the subject and what it is doing or what is happening to it.

Together, the subject and predicate form a complete sentence, expressing a complete thought.


## Sentence Types

### Simple Sentences

Simple sentences have only one independent clause, which contains a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought. They do not contain any subordinate clauses.

- Example: She sang a song.

### Complex sentences

Complex sentences, on the other hand, contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb, but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses are often introduced by conjunctions like "because," "although," "when," "if," and "since."

- Example: When she finished her work, she went home.

In this example, "she went home" is the independent clause, and "When she finished her work" is the dependent clause. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it is dependent on the independent clause.

### Compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses joined together by a conjunction or a semicolon.

- Example: She is going to the party, but he is staying home.

In this example, "She is going to the party" and "he is staying home" are both independent clauses joined together by the conjunction "but."

### Complex-compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

- Example: Although she is busy, she always finds time for her friends, and she never forgets a birthday.

In this example, "Although she is busy" is the dependent clause, and "she always finds time for her friends" and "she never forgets a birthday" are both independent clauses.


## Analysing Sentence Structure

A kernel sentence is a type of sentence that is often used in linguistic analysis as a basis for examining sentence structure and meaning. It is the simplest and most basic form of a sentence that expresses a complete thought and contains a subject and a predicate. The subject usually comes first, followed by the predicate, and there are no subordinate clauses or phrases. For example, "The cat sat" is a kernel sentence, which can be expanded into more complex sentences by adding additional words, phrases, or clauses. Kernel sentences are often used as a starting point for analyzing sentence structure and syntax, and they can be useful for identifying the key elements of a sentence and understanding how they relate to one another.

## Strategies for Building Sentences

### Connective Strategy

Building sentences using a connective strategy involves using connectives or conjunctions to link together ideas and create more complex and cohesive sentences.

One way to do this is by using coordinating conjunctions, which connect two independent clauses of equal importance. Some examples of coordinating conjunctions include "and", "but", and "or". For example, "I went to the store, and I bought some milk" or "I wanted to go to the park, but it was raining."

Another way to use a connective strategy is by using subordinating conjunctions, which connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, making the dependent clause a subordinate part of the sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include "although", "because", "when", and "while", among others. For example, "Although it was raining, I still went for a walk" or "Because I was hungry, I decided to make some dinner."

Additionally, we can use conjunctive adverbs such as "however", "therefore", "moreover", and "consequently" to connect two independent clauses with a semicolon. For example, "I wanted to go to the beach; however, it was too cold outside."

In all cases, the goal is to create a sentence that flows logically and coherently by linking related ideas using connective words or phrases.

### Subordiinate Strategy

In a subordinative strategy, a dependent clause is added to the main clause to create a more complex sentence. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence because it is dependent on the main clause to give it context and meaning. The dependent clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction (such as "because," "although," "when," "if," etc.) that indicates the relationship between the two clauses.

For example, consider the following sentence: "I went to bed early because I had an early morning meeting." Here, the main clause is "I went to bed early," and it is connected to the dependent clause "because I had an early morning meeting." The subordinating conjunction "because" shows the causal relationship between the two clauses.

Subordinative strategy allows writers to add detail, explanation, and complexity to their sentences by introducing subordinate clauses that provide additional information. These clauses can add nuance and subtlety to the meaning of a sentence, and can help to vary sentence structure and create more engaging writing. However, writers must be careful not to overuse subordinating conjunctions or create overly complex sentences that are difficult for readers to follow.

### Adjectival Strategy

An adjectival strategy is a way of building sentences by using adjectives to modify nouns. Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns and pronouns. In an adjectival strategy, adjectives are used to provide additional information about the noun in the sentence. This can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.

For example, consider the following sentence: "The big, red apple was juicy and delicious." In this sentence, "big" and "red" are adjectives that modify the noun "apple," and "juicy" and "delicious" are adjectives that further describe the apple's characteristics. By using adjectives, the sentence provides a more detailed and vivid picture of the apple.

Adjectives can also be used in a series to modify a single noun, as in the sentence: "The tall, dark, and handsome stranger walked into the room." In this sentence, "tall," "dark," and "handsome" are all adjectives that modify the noun "stranger."

An adjectival strategy can also involve modifying phrases. In this case, a modifying phrase acts as an adjective and provides more information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. For example:

```txt
The book on the shelf is mine.
```

In this sentence, "on the shelf" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "book." The phrase tells us which book is being referred to, and it acts as an adjective by providing additional information about the book.

```txt
The man with the beard is my uncle.
```

In this sentence, "with the beard" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "man." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the man's appearance.

```txt
The girl wearing a red dress is my sister.
```
In this sentence, "wearing a red dress" is a participial phrase that modifies the noun "girl." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the girl's appearance.

Overall, an adjectival strategy involves using adjectives to modify and describe nouns in a sentence, which can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.


## An Adjectival Strategy for better sentences

Generally speaking, the more we can reduce the incidence of subordinate clauses introduced by pronouns such as who, that, or which, the more we minimize possible confusion or uncertainty about the noun that that pronoun refers to, and in doing this we buy ourselves the opportunity to add useful information to the sentence without as much risk that the sentence will become hard to follow.

Not all propositions can be effectively boiled down to single modifying words or short modifying phrases, but many can, and this boiling down process allows us to pack more information into each sentence.

### Bound Modifiers

A bound modifier is a modifier that is directly attached to a specific word in a sentence, and cannot be moved to another position in the sentence without changing its meaning or creating a grammatically incorrect sentence. Bound modifiers can include adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases.

- "She wore a dress __that was made of silk__." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "that was made of silk," which modifies the noun "dress."
- "The movie, __which was directed by Steven Spielberg__, won several awards." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "which was directed by Steven Spielberg," which modifies the noun "movie."
- "He ate the pizza with anchovies, __his favorite topping__." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "his favorite topping," which modifies the noun "anchovies."

### Free Modifiers

A free modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that can be moved around in a sentence without changing its grammatical role or meaning. Free modifiers are not essential to the sentence's meaning, but they provide additional information that can clarify or enhance the sentence's meaning. Unlike bound modifiers, free modifiers are not attached to a specific word or phrase in the sentence. Instead, they can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence and still make sense. Examples of free modifiers include adverbs, adverbial phrases, and absolute phrases.

Examine the three sentences below and observer that the modifiers shown in bold can be moved without changing the meaning of the sentence.

- __Exhausted from the long day__, Maria collapsed on the couch.
- __With a smile on her face__, Jane answered the phone.
- __Excited about the news__, John jumped up and down.

For example, we can modify the sentence

- __Exhausted from the long day__, Maria collapsed on the couch.

to become

- Maria collapsed on the couch, __exhausted from the long day__.


Now the sentence starts with the independent clause "Maria collapsed on the couch" followed by a comma, then a participial phrase "exhausted from the long day" that functions as a free modifier providing additional information about Maria's state when she collapsed.

Consider this sentence from Charles Dickens:

```txt
The room was fragrant with the smell of punch, a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table, convenient to the hand of Mr. Mould; so deftly mixed that as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink, another eye, peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel, looked up at him, and twinkled like a star. 
```
This has a number of free modifiers:

- "fragrant with the smell of punch"
- "a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table"
- "convenient to the hand of Mr. Mould"
- "deftly mixed"
- "as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink"
- "peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel"
- "looked up at him"
- "and twinkled like a star"

### Modifying Clauses

A subordinative strategy involves breaking down long sentences into shorter ones and using modifying phrases instead of long noun phrases or bound modifiers in prepositional phrases. Start with a simple base clause and add modifying phrases to build longer sentences that are easier to follow.

For example:

```txt
Base clause: The dog barked.

Modifier added before the base clause: In the middle of the night, the dog barked.

Modifier added after the base clause: The dog barked, waking up the entire neighborhood.
```
