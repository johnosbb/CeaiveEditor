# Parts of Speech

## Determiners

A determiner is a word that is used before a noun to indicate which thing or things are being referred to. Examples of determiners include "a," "an," "the," "this," "that," "these," and "those."

## Adpositions

An adposition is a word that typically combines with a noun phrase to form a prepositional phrase, indicating spatial or temporal relationships between entities. Examples of adpositions include "in", "on", "at", "from", "to", "with", and "by".

## Verbs

A verb is a word that describes an action, occurrence, or state of being. It is one of the main parts of speech and is used to convey a predicate in a sentence, which tells us what the subject is doing or what is happening to it. Verbs can be inflected to show tense, aspect, voice, and other grammatical categories. Examples of verbs include "run," "eat," "jump," "be," and "think.

### Auxilary Verbs

An auxiliary verbs are used in combination with other verbs to express tense, mood, or voice. For example, "is" in the sentence "He is running" is an auxiliary verb.

## Adjectives

An adjective is a part of speech that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun by providing additional information about its qualities, states, or attributes. For example, in the phrase "the red car," "red" is an adjective that describes the noun "car." Adjectives can indicate the color, size, shape, age, or other qualities of the noun or pronoun they modify.

## Adverbs

An adverb is a part of speech that modifies or describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb. It typically provides information about time, manner, place, degree, or frequency, and often ends in "-ly" (e.g., quickly, slowly, loudly, softly). Adverbs can be used to indicate how an action is performed, to what extent, when, where, or why it is performed. For example, in the sentence "She sings beautifully," the adverb "beautifully" modifies the verb "sings" and indicates how the singing is performed.

## Nouns

A noun is a part of speech that denotes a person, place, thing, idea, or concept. It is a word that is used to name a person, animal, place, thing, or abstract idea, such as an event or quality. In English, nouns can be singular or plural, and they can be used as subjects of sentences, objects of verbs or prepositions, and in various other grammatical contexts.

### Noun Types

- Common nouns: Nouns that refer to general things, such as "book," "dog," or "city."
- Proper nouns: Nouns that refer to specific, named things, such as "Jane," "Rover," or "New York City."
- Collective nouns: Nouns that refer to a group of things, such as "herd," "team," or "family."
- Abstract nouns: Nouns that refer to intangible concepts or ideas, such as "love," "justice," or "freedom."
- Concrete nouns: Nouns that refer to physical, tangible objects, such as "table," "car," or "tree."
- Countable nouns: Nouns that can be counted, such as "book," "chair," or "cookie."
- Uncountable nouns: Nouns that cannot be counted, such as "water," "rice," or "advice."
- Possessive nouns: Nouns that indicate possession or ownership, such as "Sara's book," "the company's profits," or "the cat's toy."

# Sentence Structure

## Parts of a sentence


### Subject

In a sentence, the subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action or is being described. It is typically located at the beginning of a sentence. 

### Predicate

The predicate, on the other hand, is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and any objects or modifiers associated with the verb. It provides information about the subject and what it is doing or what is happening to it.

Together, the subject and predicate form a complete sentence, expressing a complete thought.


## Sentence Types

### Simple Sentences

Simple sentences have only one independent clause, which contains a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought. They do not contain any subordinate clauses.

- Example: She sang a song.

### Complex sentences

Complex sentences, on the other hand, contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb, but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses are often introduced by conjunctions like "because," "although," "when," "if," and "since."

- Example: When she finished her work, she went home.

In this example, "she went home" is the independent clause, and "When she finished her work" is the dependent clause. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it is dependent on the independent clause.

### Compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses joined together by a conjunction or a semicolon.

- Example: She is going to the party, but he is staying home.

In this example, "She is going to the party" and "he is staying home" are both independent clauses joined together by the conjunction "but."

### Complex-compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

- Example: Although she is busy, she always finds time for her friends, and she never forgets a birthday.

In this example, "Although she is busy" is the dependent clause, and "she always finds time for her friends" and "she never forgets a birthday" are both independent clauses.


### Phrases and Clauses

A phrase is a group of words that function as a unit in a sentence, but it does not have both a subject and a verb. Phrases can function as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, or prepositions in a sentence. Examples of phrases include prepositional phrases ("in the park"), infinitive phrases ("to run"), and participial phrases ("smiling at the camera").

A clause, on the other hand, is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can function as an independent sentence or as part of a larger sentence. There are two types of clauses: independent clauses and dependent clauses. Independent clauses express a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence, while dependent clauses cannot stand alone and must be connected to an independent clause. Examples of dependent clauses include relative clauses ("which I found in the attic"), adverbial clauses ("because I was tired"), and noun clauses ("what she said").

#### Types of Phrases

- Participial phrases: Participial phrases are made up of a participle (a verb form that can function as an adjective) and any associated modifiers and objects. They can be used to modify a noun or a pronoun, and are often used to add description to a sentence. Example: "The horse, galloping across the field, was a beautiful sight."
- Gerund phrases: Gerund phrases are made up of a gerund (a verb form ending in "-ing" that functions as a noun) and any associated modifiers and objects. They can be used as subjects, objects, or complements in a sentence. Example: "Running every day is good for your health."
- Infinitive phrases: Infinitive phrases are made up of an infinitive (the base form of a verb preceded by "to") and any associated modifiers and objects. They can be used as subjects, objects, or complements in a sentence. For example: "To be or not to be, that is the question."
- Prepositional phrases: Prepositional phrases are made up of a preposition, its object, and any associated modifiers. They can be used to indicate location, time, manner, or other relationships in a sentence. Example: "The book on the shelf is mine."
- Appositive phrase: An appositive phrase is a noun or pronoun that renames or explains another noun or pronoun right beside it in a sentence. It is usually set off by commas, dashes, or parentheses. Example: __My friend Jane, a doctor, is coming to visit me.__ In this sentence, "a doctor" is an appositive phrase that renames "Jane".
- An absolute phrase: An absolute phrase is a phrase that modifies the entire sentence. It contains a noun or pronoun and a participle, but it does not function as a typical adjective or adverb. It is usually set off by a comma. Example: __The sun having set, we made our way back home.__ In this sentence, "the sun having set" is an absolute phrase that modifies the entire sentence by giving context to the action that follows. It contains the noun "sun" and the participle "having set".
- Adverbial phrase: A phrase that functions as an adverb in a sentence, providing information about time, place, manner, degree, etc. Example: "After dinner, she went for a walk."
- Adjectival phrase: A phrase that functions as an adjective in a sentence, modifying a noun or pronoun. Example: __The man in the blue shirt is my uncle.__
- Noun phrase: A phrase that functions as a noun in a sentence, either as the subject, object, or complement. Example: __My favorite hobby is playing basketball.__
- Verb phrase: A phrase that includes the main verb and any auxiliary verbs, and sometimes includes other elements such as adverbs or prepositions. Example: "She is singing a song."
Note that these categories can overlap or be used in combination in various ways. 

## Analysing Sentence Structure

A kernel sentence is a type of sentence that is often used in linguistic analysis as a basis for examining sentence structure and meaning. It is the simplest and most basic form of a sentence that expresses a complete thought and contains a subject and a predicate. The subject usually comes first, followed by the predicate, and there are no subordinate clauses or phrases. For example, "The cat sat" is a kernel sentence, which can be expanded into more complex sentences by adding additional words, phrases, or clauses. Kernel sentences are often used as a starting point for analyzing sentence structure and syntax, and they can be useful for identifying the key elements of a sentence and understanding how they relate to one another.

## Strategies for Building Sentences

### Connective Strategy

Building sentences using a connective strategy involves using connectives or conjunctions to link together ideas and create more complex and cohesive sentences.

One way to do this is by using coordinating conjunctions, which connect two independent clauses of equal importance. Some examples of coordinating conjunctions include "and", "but", and "or". For example, "I went to the store, and I bought some milk" or "I wanted to go to the park, but it was raining."

Another way to use a connective strategy is by using subordinating conjunctions, which connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, making the dependent clause a subordinate part of the sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include "although", "because", "when", and "while", among others. For example, "Although it was raining, I still went for a walk" or "Because I was hungry, I decided to make some dinner."

Additionally, we can use conjunctive adverbs such as "however", "therefore", "moreover", and "consequently" to connect two independent clauses with a semicolon. For example, "I wanted to go to the beach; however, it was too cold outside."

In all cases, the goal is to create a sentence that flows logically and coherently by linking related ideas using connective words or phrases.

### Subordiinate Strategy

In a subordinative strategy, a dependent clause is added to the main clause to create a more complex sentence. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence because it is dependent on the main clause to give it context and meaning. The dependent clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction (such as "because," "although," "when," "if," etc.) that indicates the relationship between the two clauses.

For example, consider the following sentence: "I went to bed early because I had an early morning meeting." Here, the main clause is "I went to bed early," and it is connected to the dependent clause "because I had an early morning meeting." The subordinating conjunction "because" shows the causal relationship between the two clauses.

Subordinative strategy allows writers to add detail, explanation, and complexity to their sentences by introducing subordinate clauses that provide additional information. These clauses can add nuance and subtlety to the meaning of a sentence, and can help to vary sentence structure and create more engaging writing. However, writers must be careful not to overuse subordinating conjunctions or create overly complex sentences that are difficult for readers to follow.

### Adjectival Strategy

An adjectival strategy is a way of building sentences by using adjectives to modify nouns. Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns and pronouns. In an adjectival strategy, adjectives are used to provide additional information about the noun in the sentence. This can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.

For example, consider the following sentence: "The big, red apple was juicy and delicious." In this sentence, "big" and "red" are adjectives that modify the noun "apple," and "juicy" and "delicious" are adjectives that further describe the apple's characteristics. By using adjectives, the sentence provides a more detailed and vivid picture of the apple.

Adjectives can also be used in a series to modify a single noun, as in the sentence: "The tall, dark, and handsome stranger walked into the room." In this sentence, "tall," "dark," and "handsome" are all adjectives that modify the noun "stranger."

An adjectival strategy can also involve modifying phrases. In this case, a modifying phrase acts as an adjective and provides more information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. For example:

- The book on the shelf is mine.

In this sentence, "on the shelf" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "book." The phrase tells us which book is being referred to, and it acts as an adjective by providing additional information about the book.

- The man with the beard is my uncle.


In this sentence, "with the beard" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "man." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the man's appearance.

- The girl wearing a red dress is my sister.

In this sentence, "wearing a red dress" is a participial phrase that modifies the noun "girl." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the girl's appearance.

Overall, an adjectival strategy involves using adjectives to modify and describe nouns in a sentence, which can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.


## An Adjectival Strategy for better sentences

Generally speaking, the more we can reduce the incidence of subordinate clauses introduced by pronouns such as who, that, or which, the more we minimize possible confusion or uncertainty about the noun that that pronoun refers to, and in doing this we buy ourselves the opportunity to add useful information to the sentence without as much risk that the sentence will become hard to follow.

Not all propositions can be effectively boiled down to single modifying words or short modifying phrases, but many can, and this boiling down process allows us to pack more information into each sentence.

### Bound Modifiers

A bound modifier is a modifier that is directly attached to a specific word in a sentence, and cannot be moved to another position in the sentence without changing its meaning or creating a grammatically incorrect sentence. Bound modifiers can include adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases.

- "She wore a dress __that was made of silk__." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "that was made of silk," which modifies the noun "dress."
- "The movie, __which was directed by Steven Spielberg__, won several awards." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "which was directed by Steven Spielberg," which modifies the noun "movie."
- "He ate the pizza with anchovies, __his favorite topping__." - The bound modifier in this sentence is "his favorite topping," which modifies the noun "anchovies."


### Free Modifiers

A free modifier is a word, phrase, or clause that can be moved around in a sentence without changing its grammatical role or meaning. Free modifiers are not essential to the sentence's meaning, but they provide additional information that can clarify or enhance the sentence's meaning. Unlike bound modifiers, free modifiers are not attached to a specific word or phrase in the sentence. Instead, they can be placed almost anywhere in the sentence and still make sense. Examples of free modifiers include adverbs, adverbial phrases, and absolute phrases.

Examine the three sentences below and observer that the modifiers shown in bold can be moved without changing the meaning of the sentence.

- __Exhausted from the long day__, Maria collapsed on the couch.
- __With a smile on her face__, Jane answered the phone.
- __Excited about the news__, John jumped up and down.

For example, we can modify the sentence

- __Exhausted from the long day__, Maria collapsed on the couch.

to become

- Maria collapsed on the couch, __exhausted from the long day__.


Now the sentence starts with the independent clause "Maria collapsed on the couch" followed by a comma, then a participial phrase "exhausted from the long day" that functions as a free modifier providing additional information about Maria's state when she collapsed.

Consider this sentence from Charles Dickens:


- The room was fragrant with the smell of punch, a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table, convenient to the hand of Mr. Mould; so deftly mixed that as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink, another eye, peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel, looked up at him, and twinkled like a star. 

This has a number of free modifiers:

- "fragrant with the smell of punch"
- "a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table"
- "convenient to the hand of Mr. Mould"
- "deftly mixed"
- "as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink"
- "peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel"
- "looked up at him"
- "and twinkled like a star"

### Types of Modifiers

#### Adjectival Modifier

An adjectival modifier is an adjective that modifies the noun it is attached to.

For example, in the sentence:

- The __red__ apple is delicious

In this sentence "red" is an adjectival modifier of "apple."

#### Appositional Modifier

An appositional modifier is a noun or noun phrase that renames or explains another noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence "My friend John, __a doctor__, is coming over tonight", the noun phrase "a doctor" is in apposition to "John".

An appositional modifier is typically considered a bound modifier, as it is directly linked to and modifies the noun it is attached to.

#### Adverbial modifier

An adverbial modifier, which is a word or phrase that modifies the meaning of a verb, adjective, or other adverb by providing additional information about time, manner, degree, or frequency.

An adverbial modifier can be either a free modifier or a bound modifier, depending on its position in the sentence and its relationship to other elements.

In general, an adverbial modifier provides more information about the verb in the sentence, describing how, when, where, or why the action is being performed. When an adverbial modifier is positioned at the beginning or end of the sentence and does not closely modify any other specific element in the sentence, it is more likely to be a free modifier. On the other hand, when an adverbial modifier is positioned closer to the verb or is more closely linked to a specific noun or pronoun in the sentence, it is more likely to be a bound modifier.

For example, in the sentence "He quickly ran to the store," the adverbial modifier "quickly" could be considered a free modifier because it is not closely linked to any specific noun or pronoun in the sentence. However, in the sentence "He quickly ran to the store to buy some milk," the adverbial modifier "quickly" is more closely linked to the verb "ran" and to the purpose of the action, so it could be considered a bound modifier.

#### Participial Modifier

A participial modifier is a type of adjectival phrase that is formed from a verb's present participle (-ing form) or past participle (-ed form) and functions as an adjective in a sentence. It is considered a type of free modifier, meaning it is not directly attached to a particular word or phrase in the sentence.

- The __exhausted__ runner, panting heavily, crossed the finish line first.

In this sentence, "exhausted" is a participial modifier that modifies "runner". It is formed from the present participle of the verb "exhaust", and functions as an adjective to describe the runner.

Another example could be:

- John, __fascinated__ by the book, spent the entire weekend reading it.

In this sentence, "fascinated" is a participial modifier that modifies "John". It is formed from the past participle of the verb "fascinate", and functions as an adjective to describe John's state of mind.

### Modifying Clauses

A subordinative strategy involves breaking down long sentences into shorter ones and using modifying phrases instead of long noun phrases or bound modifiers in prepositional phrases. Start with a simple base clause and add modifying phrases to build longer sentences that are easier to follow.

For example:


- Base clause: The dog barked.
- Modifier added before the base clause: In the middle of the night, the dog barked.
- Modifier added after the base clause: The dog barked, waking up the entire neighborhood.

## Types of Sentences

### Cumulative Sentence

A cumulative sentence, also known as a loose sentence, is a type of sentence structure in which the main idea or independent clause is presented at the beginning, followed by a string of subordinate elements, such as phrases or clauses, that modify or add detail to the main idea. In other words, a cumulative sentence starts with a basic statement and then builds up additional details or information. The subordinate elements can be added in any order and can be of varying lengths and types, making cumulative sentences flexible and versatile.

Here is an example of a cumulative sentence:

-The sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a warm orange glow over the valley, illuminating the trees with shades of gold and red, and creating long shadows that stretched across the fields.

In this sentence, the main idea is "The sun was setting behind the mountains." The subsequent phrases that follow, such as "casting a warm orange glow over the valley," "illuminating the trees with shades of gold and red," and "creating long shadows that stretched across the fields," all add more detail and contribute to the overall image being conveyed.

A more elaborate example:

- The chef prepared the fish, carefully, stuffing it with wild rice, sautéing it briely, its sweet aroma blending smoothly with the other enticing odors in the kitchen, the fish 
becoming more than a food item, ascending to the status of art.

In this sentence we have the following modifiers:

| Modifier | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| "carefully" | adverbial modifier, modifies the verb "prepared" |
| "stuffing it with wild rice" | gerund noun phrase, modifies the verb "prepared" |
| "sautéing it briefly" | participial adjectival phrase modifying fish |
| "its sweet aroma blending smoothly with the other enticing odors in the kitchen" | non-finite clause functioning as an adjectival modifier, modifies the noun "fish" |
| "becoming more than a food item" | non-finite clause and functions as a subject complement or predicative nominative, modifies the noun "fish" |
| "ascending to the status of art" | noun clause  functioning as a predicate nominative, modifies the noun "fish"|

The distinction between a clause and a phrase is crucial to understanding the cumulative sentence; people trying to write cumulatives for the first time often produce comma splices.
A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined together with only a comma, which is not grammatically correct.

For example, a student attempting to write a cumulative sentence might write: "She went to the store, she bought some milk." In this sentence, "She went to the store" is an independent clause that can stand alone as a sentence. "She bought some milk" is also an independent clause. However, the student has joined the two independent clauses with only a comma, which is incorrect.

In contrast, a correctly written cumulative sentence might look like this: "She went to the store, picking up some milk and bread on the way home, where she made a delicious dinner." In this sentence, "She went to the store" is the independent clause, and the phrases "picking up some milk and bread on the way home" and "where she made a delicious dinner" modify or add information to the main clause. None of the phrases can stand alone as a sentence, so a comma splice is not possible.

### Left and Right Branching Sentences

The main feature the cumulative sentence pattern is that it packages modifiers as unbound words or phrases—in ways that usually allow them to appear in the sentences in different positions, rather than bound to the words they modify.

The terms right-branching and left-branching refer to the direction of dependency relationships between words in a sentence. In a right-branching sentence, the dependencies move to the right of the sentence's main subject or verb, while in a left-branching sentence, the dependencies move to the left of the main subject or verb.

In a right-branching sentence, the subject and main verb come at the beginning, and the modifiers follow. For example, "The cat, who was hungry, sat on the mat." Here, "The cat" is the subject, "sat" is the main verb, and "who was hungry" is a relative clause modifying "cat."

In a left-branching sentence, the subject and main verb come at the end, and the modifiers precede them. For example, "On the mat sat the cat, who was hungry." Here, "on the mat" is a prepositional phrase, "sat" is the main verb, and "who was hungry" is a relative clause modifying "cat."

The choice of left-branching or right-branching syntax can have implications for the way a sentence is perceived and understood. In general, left-branching sentences tend to place more emphasis on the modifiers, while right-branching sentences place more emphasis on the main subject and verb.

Francis Christensen (American educator, linguist, and scholar) used an alternative set of positional terms to describe the possible position within the cumulative sentence of these unbound modifiers. 
- Initial - In the opening position before the subject and the verb.
- Medial - In the middle of the sentence between the subject and the verb.
- Final - Always after the base clause.

The cumulative sentence is most typical and probably appears most frequently with the modifying phrase or phrases in the final position, since the whole idea behind the cumulative sentence is that it quickly posits a somewhat stark or kernel-like base clause (subject and verb, or subject, verb, object), then presents much more information about that base clause 
in subsequent modifying phrases. Accordingly, to give any sentence more of a cumulative form, simply replace its period with a comma and start adding modifying phrases

### Patterns of Cumulative Sentences

When we employ more than a single modifying phrase in a cumulative sentence, we can choose to combine them in patterns that are coordinate, subordinate, or mixed. Generally speaking, one mark of inexperienced or ineffective writing is that it relies heavily on sentences of only one or two levels. Just adding one new level of information to our sentences means that our sentences will contain more information, more detail, and a better explanation. 

#### Co-ordinate Pattern

In coordinate patterns, all modifying phrases refer to the base clause. Example:

- __Having completed all questions on his exam paper__, the elated boy left the exam hall.

In this sentence "__Having completed all questions on his exam paper__" modifies the base clause of "the elated boy left the exam hall"


Another example:

- __This room looks like a disaster area__, its ratty carpet stained and worn thin in many spots, its sheetrock walls pocked with cracks and holes, its broken and splintered furniture good only for firewood.

In this sentence the base clause "This room looks like a disaster area" is modified by each of the phrases that follow it.

#### Subordinate Pattern

In subordinate patterns, each modifying phrase refers to the preceding clause or phrase. Subordinate levels move the focus of the sentence forward, moving from general to specific, zooming in like a camera panning across the modifiers.  Example:

- The elated boy left the exam hall,__having completed all questions on his exam__, __handing up his paper__, __and quietly leaving the hall__.

In this sentence the three modifiers that follow the base clause "the elated boy left the exam hall" are in subordinate positions.

The most striking characteristic of the subordinate cumulative sentence is that none of its modifying phrases after the second level will make sense if placed directly before or after the base clause. Consider this example:

"While jogging in the park, __Sarah suddenly tripped over a rock__, causing her to stumble into a nearby tree and startle a group of birds, who took off into the sky in a flurry of feathers and chirps."

In this sentence, the base clause is "Sarah suddenly tripped over a rock." The modifying phrases are:

"While jogging in the park"
"causing her to stumble into a nearby tree"
"and startle a group of birds"
"who took off into the sky in a flurry of feathers and chirps"

If we were to move any of these modifying phrases to the beginning or end of the sentence, they would no longer make sense in the context of the sentence. For example, if we move "who took off into the sky in a flurry of feathers and chirps" to the beginning of the sentence, it would be unclear who or what is being referred to:

"Who took off into the sky in a flurry of feathers and chirps, while jogging in the park, Sarah suddenly tripped over a rock, causing her to stumble into a nearby tree and startle a group of birds."

Similarly, if we move "While jogging in the park" to the end of the sentence, it would also be unclear what it is modifying:

"Sarah suddenly tripped over a rock, causing her to stumble into a nearby tree and startle a group of birds who took off into the sky in a flurry of feathers and chirps while jogging in the park."

#### Mixed Pattern

We can mix these two patterns by adding subordinate levels to coordinate patterns or coordinate levels to subordinate patterns, with one or the other pattern predominating. The main appeal of mixed cumulative construction is that it combines the strength of both the coordinate and subordinate forms, allowing the sentence to move forward in time and open up new ideas, while maintaining intensity and focus.

Here is an example of a mixed pattern:

- __The chef__, known for his signature dish of grilled salmon, sautéed vegetables, and roasted potatoes, __opened his own restaurant last month__, after years of working in Michelin-starred kitchens, and has already received rave reviews from diners.

In this sentence the base clause can  be identified as "The chef opened his own restaurant last month" because it is the main clause that contains the main subject and verb, and provides the basic information that the sentence conveys. All of the other phrases in the sentence modify or add additional information to this base clause.

The first modifying phrase "known for his signature dish of grilled salmon, sautéed vegetables, and roasted potatoes" is in a coordinate pattern and refers to the base clause "the chef opened his own restaurant last month". The second modifying phrase "after years of working in Michelin-starred kitchens" is in a subordinate pattern and refers to the first modifying phrase. Finally, the third modifying phrase "and has already received rave reviews from diners" is in a coordinate pattern and refers to the base clause. This mixed pattern cumulative sentence allows for the sentence to move forward in time, while maintaining focus and intensity.

In the following mixed pattern sentence we see the potential for rythm that this form can bring:

- They drove carefully, he with hands on the wheel in his familiar position at ten and two, his eyes focused to the road, a road almost invisible beyond the sheets of rain that pelted the windshield, she checking and rechecking the map, calling out town names and possible landmarks, landmarks neither could possibly see, both growing more tense and worried by the minute, neither able to say anything.

### The Effective Cumulative Sentence

If a sentence only takes a single cumulative step, it can’t really be said to be either coordinate or subordinate, since we need at least two modifying phrases before we can make that determination. When writers add a third modifying phrase to their sentences, their prose becomes even more effective, their control of syntax even more impressive. One of the most effective moves writers can make in cumulative sentences with three or more modifying phrases is to make the final phrase either a kind of summation or make it a simile or metaphor that nails down or drives home the idea the preceding phrases build toward.

### Strategies for Creating Cumulative sentences

There are a number of strategies for adding second-level modifying phrases to the base clause of a sentence.

- Begin the modifying phrase with a verbal:
  -The runner, having completed the marathon, collapsed at the finish line.
- Begin the modifying level with a verbal plus another modifier:
  - The bird, soaring gracefully through the sky, caught the attention of the watching crowd.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an article plus one of the nouns (subject or object) from the base clause:
  - The cat, a stray that had been wandering the neighborhood for days, finally found a home with a kind-hearted family.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an article plus an adjective plus one of the base clause nouns:
  - The woman, an experienced lawyer, confidently argued her case in court.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an article plus an adjective plus almost any noun followed by a prepositional phrase:
  - The car, a vintage model from the 1960s, was carefully restored by its owner over a period of several years.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an article plus an appositive for one of the base clause nouns or a noun phrase appositive for the action of the clause:
  - The painting, a masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, sold for a record-breaking price at auction.
- Begin the modifying phrase with a possessive pronoun referring to either subject, object, or to the sense of the entire base clause:
  - The actress, her performance a tour de force, received a standing ovation from the audience.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an adverb or an article plus an adverb:
  - The speaker, clearly nervous, stumbled over her words during the presentation.
- Begin the modifying phrase with an article plus entirely new information, including even relative non sequiturs:
  - The garden, a riot of colors and scents, was a favorite spot for the elderly couple to relax.
- Begin the modifying phrase with almost anything followed by a simile or metaphor that details all or part of the base clause:
  - The athlete, a blur of motion and speed, sprinted towards the finish line.


#### Similes and Metaphores

Both simile and metaphor are figures of speech used to make a comparison between two things that are seemingly unrelated. The difference between them lies in the way they make the comparison.

A simile is a comparison between two things that are similar in some way, using the words "like" or "as" to make the comparison. For example: "Her hair was like a golden halo," or "He sings like an angel."

A metaphor, on the other hand, is a direct comparison between two things that are not literally the same. Instead of using "like" or "as," a metaphor states that one thing is another. For example: "Her eyes were stars," or "Life is a journey."

We can use similes and metaphors to extend cumulative sentences

- Simile:
- The sun set behind the mountain, __painting the sky with colors as vibrant as a freshly picked bouquet of wildflowers__.

- Metaphor:
- The car engine roared to life, __a beast awakening from its slumber__.

In both examples, the simile and metaphor are used to extend the cumulative sentence by adding a descriptive phrase that provides more detail and imagery. These figurative language devices allow the reader to visualize and experience the scene more vividly.

#### Heuristic Prompts and Prompts of Explanation

Heuristic prompts and prompts of explanation can help us create more effective cumulative sentences. The most common forms of these use the words:

- because
- perhaps
- possibly
- due to
- for
- as
- seems
- appears

Some examples of these follow:

- The team,__because__ their star player was injured, lost the championship
- The company's profits,__perhaps__ due to increased competition, have decreased.
- The concert, possibly due to bad weather, was cancelled.

In each of these examples, the base clause is extended or modified using one of the heuristic prompts to provide additional information or speculation. The use of "because" adds a causal relationship between two clauses, while "perhaps" and "possibly" introduce more tentative or speculative language.

The final step of a cumulative sentence is an ideal place for for speculation about motive or likely consequences or cause—speculation signaled by because, possibly, or perhaps. Its position at the end all benefits from the natural emphasis of that position in the sentence.


#### Cumulative Sentences and Rythm

Writers who use cumulative modifying levels will frequently alternate between long and short modifying levels for dramatic effect. Consider the following example from the Great Gatsby:

- Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.


#### Loose and Periodic Sentences

A loose sentence and a periodic sentence are two types of sentence structures that differ in the placement of the main idea or independent clause within the sentence.

A loose sentence, also known as a cumulative sentence, is a sentence structure where the main idea or independent clause is presented at the beginning of the sentence, followed by additional information or modifiers. The additional information provides further details or expands on the main idea. In a loose sentence, the main idea is presented first, and the sentence may be grammatically complete even if it is interrupted by the modifiers. Here's an example:

- __John went to the store__, bought some groceries, and met his friend for coffee.

In this example, the main idea is "John went to the store." The subsequent phrases, "bought some groceries" and "met his friend for coffee," provide additional information but do not change the meaning of the main idea. The sentence could end after the main idea and still make sense.

On the other hand, a periodic sentence (often referred to as the suspensive sentence) is a sentence structure where the main idea or independent clause is intentionally delayed or held until the end of the sentence. The sentence begins with introductory phrases or subordinate clauses, building anticipation and suspense, and culminates with the main idea or independent clause. Here's an example:

- After a long day at work, feeling exhausted and drained, with the weight of the world on his shoulders, __John finally made it home__.

In this example, the main idea or independent clause, "John finally made it home," is placed at the end of the sentence, following the introductory phrases and subordinate clauses. The sentence is structured in a way that creates suspense or builds up to the main point.

The periodic sentence seems particularly useful in situations where “if … then” constructions are frequently found. 

- __If__ you work hard, stay focused, and never give up, __then__ you can achieve your goals and turn your dreams into reality.


#### Mastering Suspense in a Periodic Sentence

initial qualifying constructions such as as "although", "even", or "if" lead to more complicated periodic structures, presenting information that becomes complete—safe to accept 
as final—only when joined with or reassessed in light of information in the base clause.

- Although she had studied diligently for months, pouring over textbooks and attending review sessions, the complexity of the exam questions caught her off guard, leaving her with a sense of uncertainty and a flicker of doubt in her mind.
- Even in the face of adversity and seemingly insurmountable challenges, he persevered with unwavering determination, drawing strength from within and inspiring those around him to rise above their own limitations.
- If we dare to dream big and embrace the unknown, venturing outside our comfort zones and taking risks, we may discover new horizons and unlock the boundless potential that lies within us.
