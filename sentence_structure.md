# Sentence Structure

## Parts of a sentence


### Subject

In a sentence, the subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action or is being described. It is typically located at the beginning of a sentence. 

### Predicate

The predicate, on the other hand, is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and any objects or modifiers associated with the verb. It provides information about the subject and what it is doing or what is happening to it.

Together, the subject and predicate form a complete sentence, expressing a complete thought.


## Sentence Types

### Simple Sentences

Simple sentences have only one independent clause, which contains a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought. They do not contain any subordinate clauses.

- Example: She sang a song.

### Complex sentences

Complex sentences, on the other hand, contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb, but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses are often introduced by conjunctions like "because," "although," "when," "if," and "since."

- Example: When she finished her work, she went home.

In this example, "she went home" is the independent clause, and "When she finished her work" is the dependent clause. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it is dependent on the independent clause.

### Compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses joined together by a conjunction or a semicolon.

- Example: She is going to the party, but he is staying home.

In this example, "She is going to the party" and "he is staying home" are both independent clauses joined together by the conjunction "but."

### Complex-compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

- Example: Although she is busy, she always finds time for her friends, and she never forgets a birthday.

In this example, "Although she is busy" is the dependent clause, and "she always finds time for her friends" and "she never forgets a birthday" are both independent clauses.
