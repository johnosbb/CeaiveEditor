# Sentence Structure

## Parts of a sentence


### Subject

In a sentence, the subject is the noun or pronoun that performs the action or is being described. It is typically located at the beginning of a sentence. 

### Predicate

The predicate, on the other hand, is the part of the sentence that contains the verb and any objects or modifiers associated with the verb. It provides information about the subject and what it is doing or what is happening to it.

Together, the subject and predicate form a complete sentence, expressing a complete thought.


## Sentence Types

### Simple Sentences

Simple sentences have only one independent clause, which contains a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought. They do not contain any subordinate clauses.

- Example: She sang a song.

### Complex sentences

Complex sentences, on the other hand, contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb, but does not express a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence. Dependent clauses are often introduced by conjunctions like "because," "although," "when," "if," and "since."

- Example: When she finished her work, she went home.

In this example, "she went home" is the independent clause, and "When she finished her work" is the dependent clause. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence because it is dependent on the independent clause.

### Compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses joined together by a conjunction or a semicolon.

- Example: She is going to the party, but he is staying home.

In this example, "She is going to the party" and "he is staying home" are both independent clauses joined together by the conjunction "but."

### Complex-compound sentences

These sentences contain two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

- Example: Although she is busy, she always finds time for her friends, and she never forgets a birthday.

In this example, "Although she is busy" is the dependent clause, and "she always finds time for her friends" and "she never forgets a birthday" are both independent clauses.


## Analysing Sentence Structure

A kernel sentence is a type of sentence that is often used in linguistic analysis as a basis for examining sentence structure and meaning. It is the simplest and most basic form of a sentence that expresses a complete thought and contains a subject and a predicate. The subject usually comes first, followed by the predicate, and there are no subordinate clauses or phrases. For example, "The cat sat" is a kernel sentence, which can be expanded into more complex sentences by adding additional words, phrases, or clauses. Kernel sentences are often used as a starting point for analyzing sentence structure and syntax, and they can be useful for identifying the key elements of a sentence and understanding how they relate to one another.

## Straegies for Building Sentences

### Connective Strategy

Building sentences using a connective strategy involves using connectives or conjunctions to link together ideas and create more complex and cohesive sentences.

One way to do this is by using coordinating conjunctions, which connect two independent clauses of equal importance. Some examples of coordinating conjunctions include "and", "but", and "or". For example, "I went to the store, and I bought some milk" or "I wanted to go to the park, but it was raining."

Another way to use a connective strategy is by using subordinating conjunctions, which connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, making the dependent clause a subordinate part of the sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include "although", "because", "when", and "while", among others. For example, "Although it was raining, I still went for a walk" or "Because I was hungry, I decided to make some dinner."

Additionally, we can use conjunctive adverbs such as "however", "therefore", "moreover", and "consequently" to connect two independent clauses with a semicolon. For example, "I wanted to go to the beach; however, it was too cold outside."

In all cases, the goal is to create a sentence that flows logically and coherently by linking related ideas using connective words or phrases.

### Subordiinate Strategy

In a subordinative strategy, a dependent clause is added to the main clause to create a more complex sentence. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence because it is dependent on the main clause to give it context and meaning. The dependent clause is introduced by a subordinating conjunction (such as "because," "although," "when," "if," etc.) that indicates the relationship between the two clauses.

For example, consider the following sentence: "I went to bed early because I had an early morning meeting." Here, the main clause is "I went to bed early," and it is connected to the dependent clause "because I had an early morning meeting." The subordinating conjunction "because" shows the causal relationship between the two clauses.

Subordinative strategy allows writers to add detail, explanation, and complexity to their sentences by introducing subordinate clauses that provide additional information. These clauses can add nuance and subtlety to the meaning of a sentence, and can help to vary sentence structure and create more engaging writing. However, writers must be careful not to overuse subordinating conjunctions or create overly complex sentences that are difficult for readers to follow.

### Adjectival Strategy

An adjectival strategy is a way of building sentences by using adjectives to modify nouns. Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns and pronouns. In an adjectival strategy, adjectives are used to provide additional information about the noun in the sentence. This can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.

For example, consider the following sentence: "The big, red apple was juicy and delicious." In this sentence, "big" and "red" are adjectives that modify the noun "apple," and "juicy" and "delicious" are adjectives that further describe the apple's characteristics. By using adjectives, the sentence provides a more detailed and vivid picture of the apple.

Adjectives can also be used in a series to modify a single noun, as in the sentence: "The tall, dark, and handsome stranger walked into the room." In this sentence, "tall," "dark," and "handsome" are all adjectives that modify the noun "stranger."

An adjectival strategy can also involve modifying phrases. In this case, a modifying phrase acts as an adjective and provides more information about a noun or pronoun in a sentence. For example:

- The book on the shelf is mine.

In this sentence, "on the shelf" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "book." The phrase tells us which book is being referred to, and it acts as an adjective by providing additional information about the book.

- The man with the beard is my uncle.

In this sentence, "with the beard" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "man." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the man's appearance.

- The girl wearing a red dress is my sister.

In this sentence, "wearing a red dress" is a participial phrase that modifies the noun "girl." The phrase acts as an adjective by providing more information about the girl's appearance.

Overall, an adjectival strategy involves using adjectives to modify and describe nouns in a sentence, which can help to add detail and specificity to the sentence.
